# Welcome to My AnimeDataBank

This is a simple Anime Database project built using the Jikan API. The Jikan API is an unofficial MyAnimeList (MAL) API that provides access to a vast amount of anime and manga information. In this project, I have utilized the API to create an anime database where users can explore and discover information about their favorite anime series.
